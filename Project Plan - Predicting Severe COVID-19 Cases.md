### Task Breakdown

#### 1.	Data Acquisition

-	Collect data from hospitals, medical centers, laboratories, Electronic Health Reports (EHR) in order to create a unified dataset.
-	Organize and catalog the information collected identifying data types, their sources, the variables and the amount of data available to enable a more efficient management.
-	Evaluate the quality of the information collected by checking for incomplete records or errors in the data ensuring data integration and consistency. This is crucial to ensure that they are suitable for use in data science analysis.

These three steps ensure that data are accessible, well documented, and able to provide valuable results.

#### 2.	Data and Context Understanding

-	Implement an initial exploratory analysis (summary statistics and basic visualizations) to get a preliminary view of the data, understanding the distribution and identifying any suspicious patterns or outliers in the data.
-	Collaborate with healthcare professionals to interpret variables and their relevance to severe Covid-19 outcomes in diabetic patients. This ensures that the variables are correctly understood, and that the analysis is aligned with clinical reality.

These steps are fundamental to starting a robust data science analysis applied to healthcare to ensure that the analysis has a meaningful impact on decision making about severe Covid-19 outcomes in diabetic patients.

#### 3.	Data Preprocessing

-	Clean the data by handling outliers, addressing missing values or correcting errors. This is crucial to ensure that the analysis is accurate, and results are not biased by incorrect data.
-	Socialize with the healthcare professionals the outliers we find that may need some investigation as in certain cases, outliers may be clinically relevant and should be investigated further before a decision is made.
-	Transform categorical variables into numerical values in order to be able to use them correctly in the machine learning algorithms to be implemented. This can be done by using techniques such as one hot encoding, label encoding, ordinal encoding and more.
-	Scale numerical features to ensure that all these variables are in the same range, facilitating comparison and analysis. This can be done by standardization and normalization techniques such as min-max scaling, robust scaling, max-absolute scaling and more.
-	Implement feature engineering to improve model performance and ensure interpretability. Create or select the features that better capture the relationships between the data and the clinical problem in order to improve the accuracy of the model. In the medical context this is especially important because data is often complex and can benefit from the inclusion of new variables. This can be done with techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination, Feature Subset Selection, Multi-Layer Perceptron and more.

#### 4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-	Perform a univariate analysis in order to understand each variable individually, allowing to detect how each variable is distributed and possible anomalies in it.
-	Perform a bivariate analysis to determine the relationship between two variables, usually between a predictor variable and the target variable, this helps to understand how an individual characteristic influences or relates to the outcome.
-	Perform a multivariate analysis to identify complex relations between several variables. This is key for problems where variables interact with each other in non-trivial ways and allows the identification of important patterns or subgroups.

These analyses provide a better understanding of the behavior of the data and a better perspective for the choice of algorithms to be used in the implementation.

#### 5.	Model Development and Training

-	Select the model to be used in the project starting with a simpler model, such as logistic regression, to get a basic understanding of the problem, given that simple models tend to be more interpretable, and then try more advanced models, such as Random Forest, to improve performance and to capture more complex patterns in the data.
-	Perform a hyperparameter tunning to obtain the best combination of hyperparameters in order to improve model performance. This can be done with techniques such as grid search or randomized search.
-	Separate the dataset into training, testing and validation data. Train the model with the set of training data and adjust the model to capture the relationships present in the data.

#### 6.	Model Evaluation and Validation

-	Test the model on the testing dataset to obtain an unbiased assessment of the model’s performance on the data it has not seen before.
-	Obtain performance metrics that provide a quantitative assessment of the model’s performance, helping to determine its effectiveness, accuracy and reliability. These metrics allow to measure how the model performs on the data, identify possible errors or limitations and compare it to other models. We will use ROC-AUC, Cohen's Kappa, Sensitivity (or True Positive Rate), and F2 scores to evaluate the models.
-	Generate detailed reports on all the evaluation metrics performed.
-	Review results with the healthcare professionals in order to assess practical utility and interpretability.

#### 7.	Model Integration

-	Develop a functional application that allows the execution of the model in an efficient, accurate and appropriate way, respecting the technical and scalability requirements.
-	Create an intuitive interface for healthcare professionals to input data and receive the response of the model.
-	Integrate the application into the hospitals HER system ensuring security policies and regulations.

#### 8.	Final Reporting and Presentation
-	Documents the methodology, all the findings, recommendations, usage of the application and all the important information that need to be communicated to the healthcare professionals that will be using the application.
-	Collect feedback for future improvements on the model.
