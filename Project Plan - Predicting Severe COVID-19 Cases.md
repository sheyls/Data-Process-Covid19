- **Problem Statement**: [Add details on identifying patients at risk of severe illness to enable early interventions.]
- **Stakeholders**: [List the stakeholders who will benefit, e.g., hospitals, healthcare organizations, policymakers.]

### 2. Cost/Benefit Analysis for Stakeholders

- **Benefits**: [Add information on how this predictive model will help stakeholders, including improvements in healthcare resource allocation, reduction in ICU admissions, better patient care, and financial savings.]
- **Costs**: [Detail the costs of developing and implementing the model, including technical resources, staff training, and maintenance.]
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: [Estimate the potential return from preventing severe cases and avoiding costs.]

### 3. Framing the Problem as a Data Science Task

- **Objective**: [Define the objective of creating a predictive model to forecast severe illness based on demographic, clinical, and hospital admission data.]
- **Data**: [Identify data types and sources to be used, e.g., demographic data, clinical data, ICU admission, and outcomes.]
- **Approach**: [Outline machine learning techniques to consider, e.g., logistic regression, random forest, deep learning models, data handling methods, and evaluation metrics.]

### 4. Work Plan & Detailed Task Breakdown

- **Task Breakdown**:
  - **Data Description and Understanding**: [Add analysis of the dataset (demographics, clinical data, ICU admissions, etc.) including key features, distributions, and data quality assessment.]
  - **Data Preprocessing**: [Explain steps to prepare the data, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical data.]
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: [Add a summary of EDA to understand relationships, identify patterns, and discover potential predictors of severe illness.]
  - **Model Development and Testing**: [Describe the process of building, training, and validating the predictive model, including model selection and tuning.]
  - **Model Implementation**: [Detail how the model will be integrated into hospital systems for real-time predictions.]
  - **Model Evaluation**: [Provide methods to evaluate model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall.]
  - **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: [Identify risks and strategies to mitigate them, e.g., data privacy, model bias.]
  - **Final Reporting and Presentation**: [Prepare a comprehensive report and presentation for stakeholders.]

- **Work Packages**: [Organize tasks into work packages reflecting different phases of the project, from data understanding to model deployment.]

- **Gantt Chart**: [Provide a Gantt chart that visually represents the timeline, highlighting key milestones and deadlines.]

- **Budget**: [Estimate the budget for the project, including costs such as computational resources, human resources.]

### 5. Risk Analysis

- **Data Risks**: [Identify issues with incomplete, missing, or biased data.]
- **Model Risks**: [Detail potential biases in predictions, accuracy issues, scalability.]
- **Ethical/Privacy Risks**: [Address challenges related to sensitive patient data and privacy regulations compliance.]
- **Operational Risks**: [Identify challenges in implementing the model in real hospital environments and training staff.]

### 6. Viability Analysis

- **Technological Feasibility**: [Assess the availability of data, computational resources, and technical skills.]
- **Financial Feasibility**: [Determine if the potential cost justifies the expected benefits.]
- **Operational Feasibility**: [Analyze how easily the model can be implemented in a hospital setting.]

### Final Deliverables

- **Project Plan Document**: [Include sections like introduction, cost/benefit analysis, data science framing, detailed task breakdown, Gantt chart, risk analysis, and viability analysis.]
- **Presentation**: [Prepare a short presentation (5-10 slides) summarizing the project plan.]

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Clarity**: [Ensure the problem and project goals are well explained.]
- **Feasibility**: [Assess the practicality of the project plan, including timeline and budget.]
- **Completeness**: [Ensure all sections are included and properly detailed.]
- **Data Understanding**: [Provide a deep analysis and description of the dataset.]
