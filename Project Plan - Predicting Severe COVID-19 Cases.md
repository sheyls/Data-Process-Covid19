**Project Plan Template for Predicting Severe COVID-19 Cases**


## 1. Introduction

- **Context of the Project**: [Add brief explanation about COVID-19 inpatients and predicting severe outcomes.]
- **Problem Statement**: [Add details on identifying patients at risk of severe illness to enable early interventions.]
- **Stakeholders**: [List the stakeholders who will benefit, e.g., hospitals, healthcare organizations, policymakers.]

## 2. Cost/Benefit Analysis for Stakeholders

- **Benefits**: [Add information on how this predictive model will help stakeholders, including improvements in healthcare resource allocation, reduction in ICU admissions, better patient care, and financial savings.]
- **Costs**: [Detail the costs of developing and implementing the model, including technical resources, staff training, and maintenance.]
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: [Estimate the potential return from preventing severe cases and avoiding costs.]

## 3. Framing the Problem as a Data Science Task

- **Objective**: [Define the objective of creating a predictive model to forecast severe illness based on demographic, clinical, and hospital admission data.]
- **Data**: [Identify data types and sources to be used, e.g., demographic data, clinical data, ICU admission, and outcomes.]
- **Approach**: [Outline machine learning techniques to consider, e.g., logistic regression, random forest, deep learning models, data handling methods, and evaluation metrics.]

### Objective

Our objective is to forecast severe COVID-19 illnesses among diabetes patients aged 40 to 6 in a reproducible and interpretable manner. 
Severe COVID-19 cases are defined based on these specific clinical criteria:
1. The need for intubation.
2. Requirement for artificial ventilation.
3. Hospitalization.
4. Admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).


The aim is to predict these outcomes using extensive data currently accessible by the government, including:
1. Demographic data: Age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors.
2. Clinical data: Information on comorbidities, diabetes management, and past medical history.
3. Hospital admission data: Admission status, current health metrics, and relevant treatment details.
4. Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health (SBDH): Factors like access to healthcare access, housing stability, and social support.

This data will go through preliminary pre-processing techniques in order to satisfy quality standards that assure that the model's training data is an accurate representation of the population. This will include steps such as cleaning the data and analyzing it to ensure that the demographical makeup of the data matches the target population to ensure reproducibility.

During modeling, interpretability will be assured through the prioritization of simple transparent models and the utilization model agnostic
tools such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and Counterfactual Explanations to provide explanations on the relationships between the inputs and the results. This will allow us to ensure that the predictive model is comprehensible by clinicians and healthcare professionals, as they must be capable of understanding the model's predictions to make informed, life-altering decisions for the patients. Similarly, proving the replicability of the results across different hospitals and regions will allow healthcare professionals to trust that the model is robust and reliable.

Since our main objective is to reduce hospital resource usage and false positives have a low resource cost, the evaluation techniques to be used will be mainly sensitivity (true positive rate) and metrics like the F2 score over other evaluation metrics such as precision (positive predictive value).

### Data
#### Data provided
As described in the objective section, our data will be sourced from:
1. Demographic data.
2. Clinical data.
3. Hospital admission data.
4. Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health (SBDH).

In this section, we will delve into:
1. the actual data we expect to get from each source
1. the integrability
1. ethical concerns
1. completeness
1. data cleanliness and required reconciliation

#### Representative data (remove the ordinals)
In order to assure that the model's results will be replicable in practice, we will require that the data used is representative of the target population that will be predicted.

Firstly, each individual sampled should belong to the demographic subset we aim to predict, i.e. patients that have been diagnosed with diabetes and are in aged 40 to 60.

Secondly, the experimental distribution of the features used should follow their actual distribution of these features in our target population.

Thirdly, the sample size should be adequate to train reliable models, which means large enough to capture possibly critical subgroups that would otherwise appear as outliers in the preprocessing of the data.

Fourthly, the data should have balanced class distribution.

Fifthly, the data should be sampled from time periods and geographical locations that are relevant to the target population. In our case, we expect the individuals sampled to represent the geographical density distributions of the territory of Spain, and be from the last year to correctly represent the rapidly changing nature of COVID-19.

Sixthly, the data should be independent, without duplicates and avoiding highly correlated cases resulting from sampling within family units.
